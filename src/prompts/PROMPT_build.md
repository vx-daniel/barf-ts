# Build Phase — Issue $BARF_ISSUE_ID (Iteration $BARF_ITERATION)

You are implementing issue **$BARF_ISSUE_ID**.

## Context

- Issue file: `$BARF_ISSUE_FILE`
- Implementation plan: `$PLAN_DIR/$BARF_ISSUE_ID.md`
- Read `AGENTS.md` for build/test commands and patterns

## Instructions

1. Follow the implementation plan exactly
2. Write failing tests first (TDD), then implement the minimal code to pass
3. Ensure all acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked `[x]` before finishing
4. Run tests and confirm they pass

## Completion

When all acceptance criteria are met and tests pass:

1. Update the issue file: change `state=PLANNED` to `state=BUILT` in the frontmatter
2. Commit your work with a clear message
